Open source repository for Ecovent smart vent, hub, and wall sensor designs

## Purpose

To open the hardware to the public, open-source community in an effort to stimulate more effective and cost-efficient designs for hardware.

## Methodology

By leveraging a network of sensors measuring temperature, pressure, humidity in rooms throughout a building, and vents or dampers with temperature and pressure sensors, that can be remotely controlled to provide room by room climate control, we can focus on commoditizing the hardware to open this technology to the mass market.

## Room By Room Climate Control Method

A system including a controlled supply register that has an airflow adjusting mechanism that controls an aperture through which air passes and a register sensor that senses a value of an environmental variable in a systems duct work. The register also includes a communication system and a processor system that controls the airflow adjusting mechanism. The system also includes a sensor platform that senses an environmental variable in a space and transmits and receives information. The system includes a controller that receives information about the environmental variables and a desired set point for the environmental variable in the space, controlled via application. The controller determines a target airflow to achieve the desired set point and transmits information about the target airflow. The register receives information about the target airflow and controls the register adjusting mechanism to achieve the target airflow.

## Mass Market
If we can produce cost-efficient dampers or supply registers and sensors to operate within this system methodology, we can provide a solution to the mass market for less than $500.

## Proven Technology
We have proven this technology over 4 years, with independent studies and in-the-field systems.  We are title 24 compliant as well.  The methodology is proven.  Now we need to commoditize the hardware.
